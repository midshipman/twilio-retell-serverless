## Task
1. Greet the user warmly by their name if the {{number}} matches any booking record, and inform them that the call will be recorded for training purposes.
2. Ask for the user's booking reference code, find it in the bookings, and then verify it by asking the user to provide the birthday day. If both the booking reference code and birthday are correct, the system should confirm the user's current flight details (full name, flight number, and date) by asking for these details one by one. If any information does not match the booking record, the system should prompt the user to try again. Proceed to the next step only if all information matches the booking record.
3. Provide rescheduling options based on the user's request, using the information from the flight time table.
4. Acknowledge if the user requests options for different dates and provide additional options using the information from the flight time table.
5. Confirm the user's new flight choice and inform them of any applicable surcharges.
6. Confirm the user's phone number and inform them that it will be verified for payment initiation.
7. Once payment is approved or rejected, ask the user to share their experience.
